# 🗺️ Product Roadmap

> **Status**: 🚧 Alpha / Sneak Peek Ready
> **Current Version**: v0.1.0

## 🚦 Release Readiness Assessment
**Is it ready for the world?**
*   **Sneak Peek / Demo**: **YES ✅**. The UI is polished, the "wow" factor (Typewriter effect, Architecture summary) is strong, and the core flow works.
*   **Public Production**: **NO ⚠️**. Currently relies on free-tier API quotas (Gemini/Groq). A heavily used public deployment would crash immediately due to rate limits. Users need to bring their own API keys, or a paid tier is needed.

## 📅 Short-term (v0.2.0 - The "Usability" Update)
Focus: Stability and User Experience for individual developers.

- [ ] **Error Handling UI**: Better UI states for API Rate Limits (currently crashes or shows console errors).
- [ ] **Custom API Key Input**: Allow users to input their own OpenAI/Gemini/Groq keys in the UI settings so they don't depend on the host's quota.
- [ ] **Mermaid Diagram Support**: Fully render the architecture diagrams generated by the Agent in the chat window.
- [ ] **Mobile Polish**: Fine-tune the floating chat interactions on mobile devices.

## 🔭 Mid-term (v0.5.0 - The "Power User" Update)
Focus: Deep analysis and broader scope.

- [ ] **Multiple Repo Context**: Compare two repositories side-by-side (e.g., "How does this fork differ architecturally from the original?").
- [ ] **File Explorer Integration**: clearer visual mapping between the "Librarian's" file list and the actual file tree.
- [ ] **Vector Database (RAG)**: Move beyond context-window dependence. Implement Pinecone or pgvector to index massive monorepos (1M+ lines of code).

## 🚀 Long-term (v1.0.0 - The "Team" Update)
Focus: Collaboration and Enterprise features.

- [ ] **Team Workspaces**: Share architectural insights and chat history with team members.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Bot that comments on PRs with architectural impact analysis ("This change modifies the core auth flow...").
- [ ] **IDE Extension**: VS Code extension to chat with the repo without leaving the editor.

## 💡 "Moonshot" Ideas
- **Codebase Refactoring Agent**: Not just analyzing, but proposing PRs to fix "Architectural Debt".
- **Visual Code Map**: 3D or 2D interactive node-graph of the repository dependencies.
